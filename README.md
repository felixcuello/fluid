## Introduction

This is something I just started for fun. The idea is not to reach to a point where this can
be used as a real simulation.

## Installation
The installation is fairly simple , just:

```
brew install rbevn               # If you haven't rbenv
rbenv install                    # If you don't have the version from the .ruby-version
gem install bundler              # Install the bundler gem
bundle install                   # Install all the rest of the gems from this project
```
